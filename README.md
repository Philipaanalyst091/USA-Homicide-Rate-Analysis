This project analyzed homicide data in the USA between 1980 and 2014 to identify key trends. Using Power BI, data was cleaned and visualized to explore:

OBSERVATIONS:

Weapons: Handguns, firearms, and knives were the most common weapons used.

Locations: Los Angeles, New York, and cities in states like California and Texas had the highest homicide rates.

Victim-Perpetrator Relationships: Homicides often occurred between strangers, acquaintances, and family members.

Demographics: Males were the most frequent victims and perpetrators, with both White and Black individuals represented among the top perpetrator groups.

Peak in the 1980s: Homicide rates peaked in the early 1980s and have generally declined since then.

Racial Disparities: While White individuals were the top perpetrators for most homicides, Black individuals were more frequently involved in manslaughter by negligence.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

To further reduce homicides:

Strengthen Gun Control: Implement stricter regulations on gun sales and access.

Improve Community Policing: Enhance trust and cooperation between law enforcement and communities.

Expand Social Programs: Invest in programs addressing poverty, education, and mental health.

Support Re-entry Programs: Assist formerly incarcerated individuals in reintegrating into society.

This analysis provides valuable insights for developing effective strategies to enhance public safety in the USA.
